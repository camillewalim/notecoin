# Notecoin - Mark II
![](https://github.com/camillewalim/notecoin/blob/mark-i-base/static/notecoin_logo.PNG)

## How to run the binaries
### Pre-requirements
* being in 'pass' or 'final' branch *(as we follow TDD, 'fail' branches are commited first, and then come the implementation to let the test pass)*
* java 1.8 installed and path-referenced from windows system/user variables.
* any .sh console installed that let you run this file run.sh

### Instructions
* Open the [/bin/run.sh](https://github.com/camillewalim/notecoin/tree/mark-ii-base/bin) file in your console
* This would open two windows per local server : one logging console, one web browser.

## How to audit the assignement ? What are Mk-I, Mk-II, Mk-III ?
### Philosophy
In my opinion, Simplicity and Sophistication are two contradictory approaches. The first brings you fast-development & low costs; the second high-added value service and scalability. I'm agnostic in that balance, and I usually scale the sophistication as per the client needs (through workshops, feedbacks & agile).

As this is an open exercise, bounded in time, and I do not have a direct access to all reviewers, here is git to help :
The three versions are properly linked through git history, so you could see the evolution of features (through TDD of course), and judge my ability to scale up a service from POC to a more advanced user-centric product.

Just plug yourself to the [level of sophistication you favor](https://github.com/camillewalim/notecoin/network):

The naming logic being : Mk-[v]_[f]-[t]
* [v] being the version ('I', 'II', 'III')
* [f] a particular feature or the final branch for a given version
* [t] being the test status of the commit ('fail' then 'pass')

### Mk-I : just the specifications
#### Goal
To strictly respect the specifications, with the minimum assumptions and no personal initiatives.

### Mk-II : from piece of code to user-centric product
#### Goal
To interpret the specifications by making some assumptions about the user needs and make the product user-centric.

This process goes through a more Domain-Driven approach, decoupling controllers (providing features to the user) from services (manipulating application data), renaming classes & packages, etc.

#### Assumptions, Solutions, Limits
